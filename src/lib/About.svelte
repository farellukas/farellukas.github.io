      Hi, my name is Farel Lukas. I am originally from Indonesia but am
      currently studying Computer Science at the University of Alberta in
      Canada. I enjoy playing sports, especially basketball, building keyboards,
      and video games. I also enjoy programming as well as learning new skills
      and technologies in the modern world.
